# python-challenge
Iâ€™ve started with creating all the folders and files needed using terminal with the MKDIR and TOUCH commands. I opened the python file from the terminal with NANO and worked a little bit like that but after all Iâ€™ve done everything on Jupyter and VSC.

Iâ€™ve missed the last class of WEEK 3 and I tried to catch up but in the end I needed a bit of help with some of the things. I used pandas from the new module which I found way easier. I did get some help from AskBCS and Google.

The code works without any errors and prints out the correct results. It creates the new text file with the printed results and I hope Iâ€™ve done it the right way ðŸ™‚
